# TTRPG-Encounter-Tester v0.1
Encounter Tester for TTRPGs beyond looking at shortcuts such as Challenge Rating

Currently being ~~developed~~ researched with D&D 5e rules in mind.

This is a personal project that might not get off the ground due to a combination of circumstances as well as if such a project would take much longer than I would like to devote time to currently.

### TODO / Research:
 - Character / Monster Stat Block formatting
 - Simple Combat (Melee, Ranged)
 - Damage Types
 
### Later Research:
 - Grid-based movement
  - Affects Possible Actions
  - Affects Area of Effect
  - Attacks of Opportunity vs Reaction abilities to save
 - Levelled Spell Combat
  - Upcasting Spells?
  - Spell Slot integration
  - Healing?
  - Area of Effect
  - Charmed effects and Mind Control
 - Conditions
  - How to apply Conditions to targets and what effects it may have on party strategy
 - Action vs Bonus Action
  - What determines what Bonus Action, if any, is used?
 - "Mercy" System
  - Should enemies attack players indiscriminantly?
  - Do certain actions change priority targets
